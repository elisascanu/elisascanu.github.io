## About me

Hello! My name is Elisa and I am currently a final year PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, School of Mathematical Sciences.

I am completing my PhD under the supervision of [Dr. Weini Huang](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/huangw.html) and [Dr. Benjamin Werner](https://www.bci.qmul.ac.uk/staff/dr-benjamin-werner/).

## Research

I am currently working on the evolutionary dynamics of extra-chromosomal DNA (ecDNA) and I am part of the team [eDyNAmiC](https://cancergrandchallenges.org/teams/edynamic). My research focuses on understanding the dynamics of multiple ecDNAs in an expanding cell population. Precisely, I use computational and analytical methodologies, informed with available data.

I am also interested in general population dynamics, mutational patterns, cancer evolution.

## Other

I love to run, I am preparing the London Half Marathon 2025 :)

I am a great cook (accordingly to my friends and family), and my best dish is Carbonara (without cream).

When it comes to my favourite place, that is definitely the sea.
